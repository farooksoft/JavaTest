MOTIVATION::
I spent an entire year living how the world wanted me too, today I just signed back up for school, because I want to live my life, 
not some dictated life, world as opted me into, I will pass school, I will get my BA I will get hit, I will fall to? my knees, 
I will go days without eating I will get back up and beat the fuck out of this world, just like it beat me to my knees this past year. 
Motivation can only come from ones self, ones self must show one that they are willing to put in the work.

"Do not believe in anything simply because you have heard it. Do not believe in anything simply because it is 
spoken and rumored by many. Do not believe in anything simply because it is found written in your religious books. 
Do not believe in anything merely on the authority 
of your teachers and elders. Do not believe in traditions because they have been handed down for many generations. 
But after observation and analysis, when you find that anything agrees with reason and is conducive to the good 
and benefit of one and all, then accept it and live up to it."
~ Mahatma Buddha

Strength does not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths. When you go through hardships and 
decide not to surrender, that is strength.

BOOK PERCEPTS:

Programmer :
I tell her this: I am a non-accredited, overly logical psychologist,therapist, mechanic, diplomat, businessman, 
and teacher working in an industry that is still defining itself each and every day.

Have compassion for everyone you meet, even if they don't want it. What appears bad manners, an ill temper or 
cynicism is always a sign of things no ears have heard, no eyes have seen. You do not know what wars are going
 on down there where the spirit meets the bone.

MOTIVATION::
I spent an entire year living how the world wanted me too, today I just signed back up for school, because I want to live my life, 
not some dictated life, world as opted me into, I will pass school, I will get my BA I will get hit, I will fall to? my knees, 
I will go days without eating I will get back up and beat the fuck out of this world, just like it beat me to my knees this past year. 
Motivation can only come from ones self, ones self must show one that they are willing to put in the work.

"Do not believe in anything simply because you have heard it. Do not believe in anything simply because it is 
spoken and rumored by many. Do not believe in anything simply because it is found written in your religious books. 
Do not believe in anything merely on the authority 
of your teachers and elders. Do not believe in traditions because they have been handed down for many generations. 
But after observation and analysis, when you find that anything agrees with reason and is conducive to the good 
and benefit of one and all, then accept it and live up to it."
~ Mahatma Buddha

“Strength does not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths. When you go through hardships and 
decide not to surrender, that is strength.”

I tell her this: I am a nonaccredited, overly logical psychologist,therapist, mechanic, diplomat, businessman, 
and teacher working in an industry that is still defining itself each and every day.

Have compassion for everyone you meet, even if they don't want it. What appears bad manners, an ill temper or 
cynicism is always a sign of things no ears have heard, no eyes have seen. You do not know what wars are going
 on down there where the spirit meets the bone.
- Miller Williams -

Software isn’t designed in an IDE or other tool. It’s imagined and created in our heads


There is a wonderful TED talk given by NewYork Times best-selling author DanPink on the surprising science of
motivation.

He argues that traditional motivational factors inbusiness,like a big bonus,can succeed,but they succeed
only on trivial tasks, like, say, entering datafrom one spread sheet in to another.
