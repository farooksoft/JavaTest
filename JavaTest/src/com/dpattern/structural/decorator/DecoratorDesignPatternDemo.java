/**
	It's a Structural pattern - Decorator pattern allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure(operates at Object level, not at class level). 
	This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern acts as a wrapper to existing class.
	
	This pattern creates a decorator class which wraps the original class and provides additional functionality keeping class 
	methods signature intact.
	<br>
	Idea: Have a Ishape interface with draw method. Let circle and rectangle implement it. Create RedShapeDecorator class which also implements and accepts IShape 
	interface objects. This class has extra methods which will add extra functionality to passed IShape objects
